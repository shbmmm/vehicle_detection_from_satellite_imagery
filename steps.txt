To create a 20km by 20km Area of Interest (AOI) region centered on the given coordinates and then overlay it with a 200m by 200m grid in QGIS, follow these detailed steps:

1. Open QGIS and start a new project:
   - Launch QGIS
   - Go to "Project" > "New" to start a fresh project

2. Set the project's Coordinate Reference System (CRS):
   - Go to "Project" > "Properties" > "CRS"
   - Search for and select "EPSG:32643 - WGS 84 / UTM zone 43N"
   - Click "Apply" and then "OK"

3. Create the center point:
   - Go to "Layer" > "Create Layer" > "New Shapefile Layer"
   - Choose "Point" as the geometry type
   - Set the CRS to "EPSG:4326 - WGS 84"
   - Add a new field called "Name" as "Text data"
   - Click "OK" and save the file (e.g., "center_point.shp")
   - Toggle editing mode for the new layer
   - Add a new feature and input the coordinates (77.2177, 28.6304)
   - Save the edits and toggle off editing mode

4. Reproject the center point to the project CRS:
   - Right-click on the point layer > "Export" > "Save Features As"
   - Set the CRS to "EPSG:32643 - WGS 84 / UTM zone 43N"
   - Save as a new file (e.g., "center_point_utm.shp")

5. Create the 20km by 20km AOI:
   - Go to "Vector" > "Geoprocessing Tools" > "Buffer"
   - Set the input layer to your reprojected center point
   - Set the distance to 10000 meters (half of 20km)
   - Save the output (e.g., "AOI_buffer.shp")

6. Convert the circular buffer to a square:
   - Go to "Vector" > "Geoprocessing Tools" > "Minimum Bounding Geometry"
   - Set the input layer to your buffer
   - Choose "Envelope" as the geometry type
   - Save the output (e.g., "AOI_square.shp")

7. Create the 200m by 200m grid:
   - Go to "Vector" > "Research Tools" > "Create Grid"
   - Set the grid extent to "Calculate from layer" and choose your AOI square layer
   - Set the grid type to "Rectangle (polygon)"
   - Set both the horizontal and vertical spacing to 200 meters
   - Save the output (e.g., "200m_grid.shp")

8. Clip the grid to the AOI:
   - Go to "Vector" > "Geoprocessing Tools" > "Clip"
   - Set the input layer to your 200m grid
   - Set the overlay layer to your AOI square
   - Save the output (e.g., "AOI_200m_grid.shp")

9. Verify and adjust (if necessary):
   - Use the measure tool to check distances and areas
   - If needed, manually adjust the AOI square or recreate it using the "Rectangle from Center and Point" tool in the Advanced Digitizing Toolbar

10. Style your layers:
    - Set a transparent fill with a visible outline for the AOI square
    - Set a thin, visible outline for the grid cells

11. Save your project:
    - Go to "Project" > "Save As" and choose a location and name for your QGIS project file

This process will create a precise 20km by 20km Area of Interest centered on the given coordinates, overlaid with a 200m by 200m grid. The use of UTM coordinates ensures accuracy in measurements. If you need any clarification on any of these steps, feel free to ask.
