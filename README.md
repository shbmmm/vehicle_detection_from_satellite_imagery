## vehicle_detection_from_satellite_imagery

This repository focuses on detecting vehicles from satellite imagery which can be can be aquired using QGIS followed by using state-of-the-art (SOTA) object detection models and software. Leveraging cutting-edge techniques, the project aims to achieve high accuracy in identifying and classifying vehicles within complex satellite images.

### Features

- **SOTA Object Detection Models**: Utilizes advanced object detection models like YOLOv5, YOLOv10, and others, known for their superior performance in various object detection tasks.
- **Image Augmentation**: Implements sophisticated image augmentation techniques to enhance model robustness and generalization.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Employs systematic hyperparameter tuning strategies to optimize model performance, ensuring the best trade-off between precision, recall, and mean Average Precision (mAP).
- **Visualization Tools**: Includes tools for visualizing detections and performance metrics, providing clear insights into model performance and areas for improvement.

### Software and Tools

- **TensorFlow** and **PyTorch**: Primary deep learning frameworks used for model development and training.
- **OGIS** : Used to load up Google satellite .tiff files and prepare a rastor followed by exporting geotagged data of the grids.
- **Google Colab**: Employed for running experiments and training models with GPU support.
